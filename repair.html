					Once we have repaired the damaged area you may still notice a small mark left on the glass. However the repair will
					return your windscreen to full strength. Repairing your glass not only restores your windscreen strength, but makes it more aesthetically pleasing to see through,
					adds safer driving vision and improves the value of your car
