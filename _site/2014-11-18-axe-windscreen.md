A car passenger had a lucky escape after an axe flew off the back of a lorry and through the windscreen of the vehicle travelling behind it.

The incident happened at around 11:00 local time on Wednesday on the busy I-95 motorway in the US.

Massachusetts State Police said that the woman in the car was "shaken" but not injured.

A landscaper was fined $200 for failing to secure the axe.
