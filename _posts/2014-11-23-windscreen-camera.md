title: Will having a windscreen camera mean my MOT will fail?
---
----------
Q. A few years ago I had a camera fitted to my windscreen so I would have video evidence in the event of a collision or fraudulent insurance claim. Previously this has caused no problem at the MoT test, but before my most recent inspection my garage removed the device, saying my car would have failed otherwise. Why is this, and would refitting the camera be breaking the law?

----------
A. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa, now replaced by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, or DVSA) wrote to all MoT test centres in March to clarify the rules relating to windscreen obstructions, which may explain why your camera was removed. In simple terms, a car may fail its MoT if there is damage or an obstruction in the "swept area" of the windscreen greater than a 40mm diameter circle. In "zone A" — a 290mm-wide band of the screen immediately in front of the driver and centred on the middle of the steering wheel — this is reduced to a 10mm-diameter circle.
