---

A car passenger had a lucky escape after an axe flew off the back of a lorry and through the windscreen of the vehicle travelling behind it. 

The incident happened at around 11:00 local time on Wednesday on the busy I-95 motorway in the US. 

Massachusetts State Police said that the woman in the car was "shaken" but not injured. A landscaper was fined $200 for failing to secure the axe.
